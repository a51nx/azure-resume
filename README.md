# azure-resume
 My resume hosted on Azure!

 ## First steps 
 - frontend folder contains .html for the website 
 - main.js contains visitor counter code

Blockers 
- Not having SSH set up to have my local machine access my Git repo 

## Considerations
- I shouldn't be pushing to master... but I'm lazy
