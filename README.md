# azure-resume
 My resume hosted on Azure!

 ## First steps 
 - frontend folder contains .html for the website 
 - main.js contains visitor counter code

## Blockers 
- Not having SSH set up to have my local machine access my Git repo
- VSCode Azure extension wasn't listing out my subs / resources (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azure-account/wiki/Troubleshooting#unable-to-list-subscriptions)
- When creating service principle using az ad sp create-for-rbac... (https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/use_cli_with_git_bash.md#auto-translation-of-resource-ids)

## Considerations
- I shouldn't be pushing to master... but I'm lazy

## Learnings ? 
- Serverless - if you don't need something up all the time, this is cheaper. No need to worry about standing up infra
